# One

## A card game for my son

###### And an assignment for Coder Academy

### Software Development Plan

#### Statement of Purpose and Scope

The game One is to be a Ruby language software version of Uno. It differs from the original game in that there are a few rules that have changed and a number of features implemented that are not in the original game of Uno.

The basics of the game remain the same. The aim of the game is to be the first player to lose all his or her cards. The deck is made up of cards consisting of the following:

- [ ] 4 different coloured cards (red, blue, yellow and green) with numbers ranging from 0-9. There are two of every number except 0 of which there is only one.
- [ ] In each colour  category, there are also special cards - skip, reverse and pickup 2.
- [ ] There are 3 wild cards which can be any colour determined by the player.
- [ ] There are 4 wild Pickup 4 cards

Each player starts with 7 cards and takes turns to discard a card onto a discard pile. The player can only play a card from their hand if it matches the top card of the discard pile by colour or number. If the player cannot play a card, they pick up from the deck. 

This is a game that is played by my son and I almost every evening. I wanted to develop it to test my coding ability.
